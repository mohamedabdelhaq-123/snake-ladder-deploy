# Quick Game Logic Test
A quick test written by hand to see if the game logic makes sense and explore general potential issues

### Notes
- Board is defined as grid rather than line
- PlayerId is considered the main identifier to different player data objects of different types
- tiles are defined using callbacks, allowing for custom tiles
- win is assumed if reach or pass position
- check TODO tag in code
